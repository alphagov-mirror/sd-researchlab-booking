## Research Lab Booking Service

This is a prototype booking service to scope out a more ideal way to book the Research Labs at GDS.

The booking process will be very simple. The Lab calendars will be displayed (Free/Busy only) and a simple date/time picker and a notes section.
Once the user has submitted the booking it will be displayed as a tentative booking until such time as (by whoever will manage the process) has confirmed the booking. Initially the confirmation can be done (as it will be GDS) through the Google Calendar itself.

All notifications will be either through Google itself (initially) and/or Notify.
